## Hybrid Book Recommender System Using Collaborative Filtering and Popularity-Based Recommendations

This is a simple school project implemented for Recommender Systems course on Computer Engineering Masterâ€™s Degree 
program. It simply recommends books for the users who already have some ratings in the dataset using Collaborative 
Filtering. For the users who do not have any ratings yet, the system uses Popularity-Based recommendations to prevent 
user based cold start.
